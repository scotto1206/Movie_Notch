# Movie_Notch

Project webiste for movie review and news. Currently under development.

Self-tought coder initial site was built out with HTML/CSS. 
Found out quickly that scaling to add many pages would be tedious with manually doing links etc.

Landing page is up now, but I am currently learning GatsbyJS in hopes to use that framework and a Headless CMS.
