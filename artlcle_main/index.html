                        New England Patriots fans still care greatly about Tom Brady, and they have the numbers to prove it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How much do they care? Well, according to John Ourand of Sports Business Journal, more people in Boston watched Brady and the Buccaneers win the Super Bowl LV than they did in Tampa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The local viewership rating in Boston for Tampa Bay’s 31-9 pounding of the Kansas City Chiefs was a 57.6, Ourand reported. That beats the 52.3 rating in Tampa. Boston, of course, is the Patriots’ home base. Brady, of course, led the Patriots to nine Super Bowls, winning six.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        The 57.6 rating in Boston marks the second best Super Bowl rating in that market, beating the Boston DMA ratings for most of the Patriots Super Bowls.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        He went to No. 10 and won No. 7 on Sunday. Those figures surpass any player or team. But Brady wasn’t the only former Patriot on the field. No less than former Patriots tight end Rob Grankowski caught two touchdown passes for the Buccaneers. Antonio Brown, also a member of the Patriots for a minute, caught another.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All in all, it was quite a day for former Patriots, a day that the Buccaneers had hoped would come to fruition when they signed Brady and friends during the offseason. For a while, there were doubts, such as when the Buccaneers fell to 7-5 following a loss to the Chiefs in Week 12.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Patriots fans probably knew that was far from the end. And clearly, they were smart enough to keep watching until the very finish.
