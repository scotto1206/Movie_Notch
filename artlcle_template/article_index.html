                        LeBron james is more known for his sick dunks than his crossover. Will he be able to pull off the greatest sports film crossover of 2021?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The OG Space Jam was a movie that could have been complete trash. Lets face it on the surface it seems obvious: Looney Tunes and Michael Jordan in a sports movie during the time he was out of the league playing minor league baseball! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Luckily, it was a huge hit, maybe not at the box office, but for 90s kids across America. Quoting the movie at school, playing scenes out at recess, and getting cartoon crushes on Lola Bunny. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The movie stood out as being able to make live action actors mingle well with animation for its time. It had a great mix of comedians, sports stars, and killer soundtrack making it a hit for kids. Now those kids are grown up and have been talking about a sequel since 1996. Will Space jam 2: A New Legacy, coming out July 16th match up? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        God I hope so, but from the little press we've seen, maybe they're hiding something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What made Space Jam work was it had MJ away from pro basketball, and everyone wondered why. It was a great plot ploy with out of the loop monsters underestimating him and losing to the Tune Squad. LeBron James is still on the mountain top of the NBA after winning another championship in 2020. How the hell is that gonna work?

                    <p>
                        In this day and age with Internet, I can't imagine that angle will play this time. There has only been a teaser released for an HBO Max promo reel showing about 1.5 seconds of footage. It appears that LeBron and Bugs are in the animated world and their friends are being kidnapped by UFOs (Pixels ripoff much?). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        USA Today put out a snippet of the plot, which is Looney Tunes and Bron Bron doing their rendition of Tron. LeBron and his kid get trapped inside of a digital world that somehow has Bugs and Co. in it to win in a basketball game against new opponents to escape. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The thing is I like elements of all of that, will they pull this off is BIG question. I love Tron, especially Tron: Legacy with its high rez Grid and Soundtrack by the new retired Daft Punk. Maybe an unconscious nod to that movie with the 'Legacy' tag on SJ2? Father son duo, it's a timeless storyline and hopefully their time trapped will show some good bonding and character growth. It will also give a glimpse to what it may look like once LeBron's IRL son LeBron Jr. gets into the league. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This rendition has some things going for it, LeBron has been around Hollywood with some acting gigs in the past. Ryan Coogler of Black Panther fame is producing. I hope they can put together a movie worthy of calling itself a Space Jam Successor. 
                    </p>

                        There hasn't been a full trailer released yet, only the jerseys and teaser. Are they playing it safe and not showing much of the movie to avoid fanboy backlash? I'm not sure, but if it can be Space Jam's version of Ep.7 from Star wars and soft reboot it and keep it entertaining I'm in. If it falls flat with a bad script that has some typical tropes but doesn't push this to be fresh, it'll be called a cash grab.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will wait in anticipation and be watching on July 16th no matter what, but lets just say I'm not rushing out to buy the new jersey just yet.
